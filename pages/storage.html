          <p>OSCO Movers provides a full range of professional removals services throughout London.
          </p>
          <p>Whether you’re a family who are moving home or a business looking to relocate to a new office, our
            friendly, experienced and reliable team are here to make your move go as smooth, swift and stress-free as
            possible.
          </p>
          <p>Our wide range of removals services includes everything from a full relocation, where we handle all the
            packing, moving and unloading for you, to a man and van service, for when you just need a bigger vehicle and
            an extra pair of hands. We also offer storage, shipping and end-of-tenancy cleaning.
          </p>
          <p>We’re a fit, friendly and hard-working bunch at Kiwi Movers, and we pride ourselves on providing an
            efficient, reliable and high-quality service at competitive prices. Not only will you have peace of mind
            knowing that your move is being handled by professionals, but you can also rest assured that you’re getting
            the best value for your money.
          </p>
          <p>What makes us really special (aside from the majority of our staff being Kiwis, of course!) is our
            problem-solving mentality and unique set of skills and experiences. Staying true to New Zealand’s “Number 8
            wire attitude,” our team draw from a variety of industries and disciplines — including project management,
            engineering and construction management — enabling them to come up with creative solutions to overcome any
            removals-related challenge.
          </p>
          <p>Due to its busy roads, tricky parking and calendar of major events, planning a move in London without
            expert help can be a nightmare. Thankfully, we’re pretty good at navigating the city (if we do say so
            ourselves). With headquarters in Wandsworth, South West London, and over 10 years of experience doing
            removals throughout the city, we have plenty of practical knowledge to make sure your move never hits a
            roadblock.
          </p>
          <p>Whatever kind of help you need, Kiwi Movers are here to remove the hassle, headache and hard work of
            moving.
          </p>

          <h3>What kind of removals do we perform?</h3>
          <p>When you’re moving, whether it be for a home move, office move, or anything else, it’s an exciting time!
            But here at Kiwi Movers, we also know how stressful it can be too. Especially when you’re moving in and
            around London, which we all know can be a little overwhelming and hectic!
          </p>
          <p>That’s why we’re dedicated to making your life a little bit easier and helping you to enjoy your move with
            more time to focus on other things – no one wants to be worrying about removals! London is a big, thriving
            and exciting city, but all house/student/office movers in London know that it can be a tricky experience to
            organise.
          </p>
          <p>Fortunately, when you choose Kiwi Movers as your London removal company, we’ll do everything we can to
            help. We’ve got a lot of experience and expertise under our belt, and we always bring our top
            professionalism and organization to the job! Unfortunately, not all removal companies in London have the
            same standards – but when you choose us, you can be guaranteed that you’re in good hands.
          </p>
